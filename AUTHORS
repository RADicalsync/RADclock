The RADclock algorithm and project was launched by Darryl Veitch in 2003.
It consists of a research effort into network timekeeping and associated
software. For completeness, all contributors in the broad sense are given here.
This repo is focussed on the C codebase and associated support for the running
of the RADclock daemon live in an operating system with compatible FFclock
components.
