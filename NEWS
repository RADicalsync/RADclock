## RADCLOCK NEWS
##

After being reactivated in recent years in V0.4 with completed and enhanced
FreeBSD FFclock support, RADclock has now jumped ahead to V0.8, covering a
number of significant advances including the move to mRADclock (multiple
servers), and a completely new FFclock implementation for modern Linux including
for the Raspberry Pi, together with an Earthly based build system.
See the RAD_0.8 tag commit and ChangeLog for more details.
