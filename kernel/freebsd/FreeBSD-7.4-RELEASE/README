FreeBSD 7.4-RELEASE - kernel patching instructions

The kernel patches come with a series file to apply patches using quilt.

Another options is to use the patch command as follows (assuming sources have
been installed in /usr/src):

cd /usr/src
patch -Np1 < PATH/TO/radclock/kernel-patches/freebsd/FreeBSD-7.4-RELEASE/*.patch
