/* =============================================================================
 * PATHPENALTY METRIC
 * ===========================================================================*/

/* Goal: to track a robust measure of path quality over a "path_scale" timescale
 * relevant for the prediction of typical rAdclock quality over that path
 * over that timescale. The metric is used by preferred_RADclock as the
 * main basis of preferred server selection.
 *
 * The penalty comprises three components measured in [s]
 *    Pbase       impact of the value of the RTT BaseLine
 *    Pchange     impact of the changes in RTT BL (asym implications of level shifts)
 *    Pquality    impact of stamp absence, congestion quality, or insanity
 * and is defined as
 *    pathpenalty = Pbase + Pchange + Pquality
 *
 * The three components are designed to be approximately decoupled, focussed
 * on different types of impacts :
 *  Pbase:    average overall environment  (insensitive to BL shifts and quality]
 *  Pchange:  quantifying a bound on the asymmetry-error impact of BL shifts
 *  Pquality: dynamic performance of rAdclock, given the base and irrespective of
 *            asymmetry, incorporating path congestion and stamp availability
 *
 * Pathpenalty is a heuristic that does not correspond directly to clock
 * error or a clock error bound, which are hard to estimate and therefore would
 * not be a robust choice for the important task of preferred server selection.
 * However in some circumstances pathpenalty's components do correspond to
 * an estimated clock error bound. For example Pbase is an average bound on worse case
 * path asymmetry error. Under persistent starvation Pquality bounds worst case
 * drift that will dominate pathpenalty, and then be understood as a bound on
 * the clock error. Pathpenalty can be thought of as an "error risk" metric
 * that reflects risks from all the main sources of clock error.
 *
 * Notes on stampgap definition and treatment
 *  - a stampgap processed internally here once a new stamp finally arrives
 *    corresponds to the state->rawstampgap tracked externally in preferred_RADclock
 *    Before it arrives, but is handled differently. Externally it is added in
 *    directly (linear increase in pathpenalty), here it is subject to EWMA smoothing,
 *    which will decrease its impact. This is appropriate when seeking to measure the
 *    average impact of gaps of different durations over the path. Externally,
 *    the main goal is to detect persistent starvation (unavailable server) rapidly
 *    (unconstrained by path_scale), for timely transition to a suitable backup.
 *
 * Notes on timescale for path evaluation
 * Considerations:
 *  - should use same timescale for each server for fair comparison
 *  - make sense to use the same scale for each of Pchange, Pquality, churn_scale
 *  - should be smaller than history_scale for consistency (but no need to enforce)
 *  - should be larger than shift window, but this varies with server, too complicated
 *  - should be large enough to see typical results, away from algo reaction
 *    to changing path conditions, and to avoid jitter from most source
 *  - but small enough so no long wait to move to clearly better alternative
 *  - complicated to automate: going with expert setting around 5hrs
 * Context: time to drift 1ms ~ 3hrs;
 *   (small,classic,typical,max) shiftwin: 100samples @ pp=1,16,64,1024) ~ (1.7m,27m,1.8h,28h)

 * CLOCK SYNCHRONISATION ALGORITHM
 * ===========================================================================*/

/* This routine takes in a new bi-directional stamp, a four-tuple (Ta,Tb,Te,Tf)
 * associated to a given time server, that is assumed to be fundamentally sane,
 * and uses it to update the parameters of the bidir RADclock.
 *
 * The RADclock can we thought of a dual algorithm, which maintains a robust
 * estimation of the parameters (phat,K) of the "Uncorrected clock" :
 *   C(t) = vcount(t)*phat + K
 * which forms the basis of the "difference clock" Cd, used for the measurement
 * of time intervals below a certain timescale (~1000s), and the "Corrected" or
 * "Absolute clock"
 *   Ca(t) = C(t) - theta(t)
 * where the estimation of the drift correction function theta(t) enables its
 * use for the measurement of Absolute time (on a leap-free timescale).
 *
 * state: holds all variables, stored from the previous stamp (i-1), needed to
 *   process the new stamp (i) and hence update algo parameters.
 *   As the algo proceeds, state members are progressively updated, starting with
 *   stamp_i and RTT before the calling of the sub-algos, and ending with the
 *   stamp argument. Other members are updated within the sub-algos in order:
 *   {[window management], RTT, phat, OWDasym, plocal, thetahat}.  Once updated,
 *   they move from an interpretation of "previous stamp value" to "current value".
 *   Outside the algo (inbetween stamp arrivals), all members relate to the last
 *   stamp processed.
 *   Note that updated variables may not actually have changed in value: the
 *   previous value may still be appropriate, or a candidate replacement value
 *   rejected due to quality or sanity-checking reasons.
 *
 * RADclock is structured hierarchically for robustness. The sub-algos
 *    {window management, RTT, phat, plocal,  thetahat, pathpenalty}
 *    {                              OWDasym,                      }
 * address progressively more difficult problems and depend only on the
 * sub-algos on its left in this list, but there is no dependency to the right.
 * An exception is when RTT (measured natively in raw counter units) needs
 * to be expressed in seconds for some purposes, requiring an estimate of phat
 * to do so. However for these purposes this estimate need not be highly accurate.
